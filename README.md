## **Description**

This is the professional portfolio website for the programming student Logan Bonnesen. 

This project created my first functional professional portfolio. All the code was written by me. This project will be a work in progress as my portfolio of deployed applications grows and as my skillset develops. By the end of the bootcamp this portfolio should contain several deployed projects with more eye-catching styles applied.
